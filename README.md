MIT Bus Tracker Page

In week 9 of the MIT xPro course, we focused on asynchronous code. Check out the project to see where the MIT bus travels along its route with this tracker!

How to run: Visit my website, nmc1313.github.io for a direct link to the project! 

Future improvements: Add different marker styles for various conditions, such as red for a full bus.
